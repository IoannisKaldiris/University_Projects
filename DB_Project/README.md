## About 

This software was developed as part of the course Software Engineering (CEID_24Y334) at the **[Department of Computer Engineering and Informatics](https://www.ceid.upatras.gr/en/)** at the **[University of Patras](https://www.upatras.gr/en/)**. It has two objectives. First, to familiarize yourself with the design, implementation, data input, and processing in a relational Database (DB). Second, to use JDBC technology to connect the DB with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) implemented in Java, gaining experience in designing a more complete application.  

As part of the project, you will study the relational schema of the DB, extend it with additional fields and new tables, and insert an appropriate number of records. Note that the database resembles the one used in lab exercises, ensuring a better understanding of the problem you'll be managing.  

This project focuses on building a relational database system for an on-demand movie service provider. It aims to familiarize developers with database design, data insertion, and manipulation using JDBC to create a complete application with a Java-based GUI.

Key features include managing movies, actors, categories, customers, and rental information. The relational schema allows for handling complex relationships such as actors participating in multiple movies, customers having unique addresses, and movies belonging to various genres. Customers can rent movies from a catalog and make payments for each rental, with detailed transaction and customer information stored in the database.

This project provides an excellent opportunity to explore database expansion, assumption-based system design, and practical application development.
