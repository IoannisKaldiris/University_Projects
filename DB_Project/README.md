## About 

This software was developed as part of the course Software Engineering (CEID_24Y334) at the **[Department of Computer Engineering and Informatics](https://www.ceid.upatras.gr/en/)** at the **[University of Patras](https://www.upatras.gr/en/)**. This project focuses on building a relational database system for an on-demand movie service provider. It has two objectives. First, to familiarize yourself with the design, implementation, data input, and processing in a relational Database (DB). Second, to use JDBC technology to connect the DB with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) implemented in Java, gaining experience in designing a more complete application.
