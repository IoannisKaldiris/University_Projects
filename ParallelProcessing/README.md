## About 

This project was developed as part of the course Software Engineering (CEID_1057) at the **[Department of Computer Engineering and Informatics](https://www.ceid.upatras.gr/en/)** at the **[University of Patras](https://www.upatras.gr/en/)**.

The aim of this project is to develop a collaborative system for registration
requests for assistance (types of need) and the servicing of needs in a community that
has been affected by a natural disaster (e.g. flood, earthquake, etc.). Through the platform,
a citizen can declare that they have requirements for various items (eg water, food, medicine)
or to state that they have a surplus and can donate certain items.
