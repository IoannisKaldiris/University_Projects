## About 

This project was developed as part of the course Software Engineering (CEID_1092) at the **[Department of Computer Engineering and Informatics](https://www.ceid.upatras.gr/en/)** at the **[University of Patras](https://www.upatras.gr/en/)**.

The goal of this project is to develop a collaborative system for registering requests for aid (essential supplies) and addressing the needs of a community affected by a natural disaster (e.g., flood, earthquake, etc.). Through the platform, a citizen can either declare specific needs for various items (e.g., water, food, medicine) or indicate that they have a surplus of items and are willing to donate.
